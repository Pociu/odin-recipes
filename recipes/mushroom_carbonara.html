    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Mushrooms take the place of the traditional cured pork in this vegetarian
      carbonara recipe—but fear not, the dish does not lack depth of flavor! A
      deep browning on the mushrooms, coupled with garlic and shallots, brings
      the humble button mushroom to a higher place.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1½ lb. crimini or button mushrooms</li>
      <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 medium shallots</li>
      <li>1 cup parsley leaves with tender stems (about ½ bunch)</li>
      <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>4 oz. store-bought pre-grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>1½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus more</li>
      <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 lb. orecchiette</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with water and season well with a few big pinches of
        salt. Bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, do some veg prep! Tear off and discard stems of 1½ lb.
        crimini or button mushrooms, then tear them into quarters (or in halves
        if small). Transfer to a medium bowl. Lightly smash and peel 6 garlic
        cloves, then thinly slice. Peel and finely chop 2 medium shallots. (A
        small red onion will work fine in a pinch.) Coarsely chop 1 cup parsley
        leaves with tender stems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk 5 large egg yolks, 1 large whole egg, 4 oz. store-bought
        pre-grated Parmesan (about 1¼ cups), and 1½ tsp. freshly ground black
        pepper in another medium bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high for a good 3 minutes. You want
        to get the pan very hot since adding the mushrooms is going to lower the
        temperature of the surface of the pan. Toss mushrooms and ¼ cup
        extra-virgin olive oil once in pan to coat in oil. Cook, tossing once
        every 4–5 minutes (but mostly undisturbed), until mushrooms are mostly
        golden brown, 13–16 minutes. This will take some time and they will let
        out a lot of moisture before they start to brown, so stick with it!
      </li>
      <li>
        Once mushrooms have been cooking for about 10 minutes, drop 1 lb.
        orecchiette into boiling salted water and set a timer 2 minutes shy of
        al dente according to package directions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Back to those mushrooms! Once you’ve finished the browning process,
        reduce heat to medium-low and add garlic, shallots, and 1½ tsp. salt.
        Cook, stirring often, until aromatics are softened but not browned,
        30–60 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        When pasta is 2 minutes shy of al dente, scoop out 2 cups pasta cooking
        liquid, then drain pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add pasta along with 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to mushroom mixture.
        Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often to finish cooking the pasta
        and absorb liquid, about 2 minutes (this is why you’re cooking the pasta
        2 minutes shy of al dente; it allows for the flavors to meld as the
        pasta finishes cooking in the sauce). Remove from heat and let cool 1
        minute. (Don't skip this step—if the pasta is too hot when you add the
        egg mixture, it will turn into scrambled eggs instead of a luxurious
        sauce.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add ½ cup pasta cooking liquid to reserved egg mixture and whisk to
        combine and loosen eggs. Gradually add egg mixture to pot, stirring
        vigorously with a wooden spoon and adding more pasta cooking liquid as
        needed to loosen things up, until a very creamy, luscious sauce coats
        all noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add parsley and stir again to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning for
        salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide pasta among bowls. Top with Parmesan and a few cranks of pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
